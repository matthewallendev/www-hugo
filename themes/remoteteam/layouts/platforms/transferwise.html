          <p>
            There are many international payment platforms out there. However,
            we decided to go with TransferWise borderless account because its
            features are ideal for remote teams. It has simple dashboards, offer
            a lot of options for remote companies to pay their employees. With
            these features, we saw that integrating TransferWise with RemoteTeam
            will give remote companies the most powerful tools they’ll ever need
            to run successful companies.
