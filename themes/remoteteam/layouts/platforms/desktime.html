          <h3 class="mb-3 mt-2">Advantages of using DeskTime</h3>
          <p>
            Without a remote employee time tracking software, a lot of
            productive work hours are being lost. This is how Desktime time
            tracking makes your remote team better at productivity.
          </p>
          <h3 class="my-6">An ingredient for improving your team’s focus</h3>
          <p>
            While multitasking might seem productive because you get to do a lot
            of things at a time, it’s stifling overall productivity in many
            cases. Desktime’s remote employee time tracking software helps your
            remote team to log and assign time to specific tasks to avoid
            multitasking. It helps them focus on the work at hand and then move
            on to the next once they’re done.
          </p>

          <h3 class="my-6">Identify your productivity booster</h3>
          <p>
            Some remote employees need a co-working space to produce great work.
            Others do their best when in bed. Some work harder at a coffee shop.
            But how can you identify your unique productivity booster? Desktime
            would help you identify where you were more productive, the places
            you’re usually not working well – and helps your remote employees to
            adjust for the better.
          </p>

          <h3 class="my-6">Makes you a time management guru</h3>
          <p>
            How do you even manage your time when you don’t know how you’re
            using it? Using Desktime to track your remote team’s time would help
            you identify the amount of time each member needs to accomplish
            certain tasks. This makes it easy for you to schedule their time,
            assign tasks, and create deadlines appropriately.
          </p>

          <h3 class="my-6">Manage stress</h3>
          <p>
            Juggling a lot of work. Not knowing how much time your remote team
            spends on specific tasks. And just going with the flow and starting
            and ending work whenever you feel like can all increase your remote
            employees’ stress. By using Desktime, you’re able to help your
            remote team organize tasks and take control of their time – by
            knowing when to work, when to take a break, and when to call the day
            off.
