            Know the status of your payment
          </h3>
          <p>
            Stop guessing the status of your payments to remote employees and
            freelancers. Track the status of your payments at every stage of the
            transfer. Get visibility of how your money travels and how long it
            takes to be credited to your remote employeesâ€™ accounts at no extra
            cost.
