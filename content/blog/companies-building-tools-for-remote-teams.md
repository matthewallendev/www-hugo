One thing you can count on from your remote team: increased productivity. A study in the Harvard Business Review revealed that <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/01/to-raise-productivity-let-more-employees-work-from-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-rt-link-type="external">remote employees completed nearly an extra day’s worth of work every week</a> compared to their in-office colleagues. This increase in productivity could be attributed to a multitude of things depending on the individual employee.

With remote work on the table, a world of possibilities opens up. Now, you can hire a UX designer who is based in Valencia to build out the structure of your website, or a virtual assistant based in Bali to handle the daily admin needs of your business. The best part - whether you have one remote employee or many, the communication channels between your team don’t have to become more complicated. Video calls and a time zone calculator are your new best friends.

<strong>In this article, we are going to talk about the companies that they are building tools for remote teams.</strong>
<h2><strong>Remote Team Inc.</strong></h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hebu10lmu/image/upload/v1588681029/content/companies-building-tools-for-remote-teams/image_snqzjo.jpg" />

<a href="http://remoteteam.com">Remote Team</a> is an HR platform for remote or virtual teams. Remote Team lets you create customized time-off policies, automate your payrolls, manage your documents online and monitor productivity for your employees. It also automates payrolls with integrations with DeskTime, Toggl, and TransferWise.

<strong>Remote Team helps you to tune in with your distributed team.</strong>
<h2><strong>Hubstaff</strong></h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hebu10lmu/image/upload/v1588680153/content/companies-building-tools-for-remote-teams/hubstaff_usajrt.jpg" />

<a href="http://hubstaff.com">Hubstaff</a> is a remote company that provides staff monitoring through time tracking software. The company was founded after its co-founders wanted a better way to manage their team of freelancers. The company is an advocate for the introduction of staff monitoring services for United States government roles. This was following a number of large invoices that have been paid by the US government for contracted work, with no proof of the hours spent on the project. Hubstaff was seen as a rising tech company in 2015 when they received a nomination as part of Techpoint’s Mira Awards for The Best of Tech in Indiana.

<strong>Hubstaff is a very cool and light tool for time tracking. As a time tracking, payment management, and employee monitoring software, Hubstaff does a great job.</strong>
<h2><strong>Asana</strong></h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hebu10lmu/image/upload/v1588680249/content/companies-building-tools-for-remote-teams/asana_zwpc2m.png" />

Asana is a software-as-a-service designed to improve team collaboration and work management. It helps teams manage projects and tasks in one tool. Teams can create projects, assign work to teammates, specify deadlines, and communicate about tasks directly in Asana. It also includes reporting tools, file attachments, calendars, and more.

There’s been quite a bit of talk about Asana in the tech world, and when you consider some of the names involved with the endeavor, it’s easy to understand why. Co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Justin Rosenstein both held key positions on Facebook’s early startup team, and Asana’s backers include Benchmark Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund and Peter Thiel.

<strong>Āsān means "easy to do" or "easy to learn" in Persian that is parallel to its user-friendly interface and the usage of the tool.</strong>
<h2><strong>Toggl</strong></h2>
<img class="size-full aligncenter" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hebu10lmu/image/upload/v1588680327/content/companies-building-tools-for-remote-teams/toggl_l9kd5v.jpg" />

Toggl is a time tracking app operated by Toggl OÜ, headquartered in Tallinn, Estonia, that offers online time tracking and reporting services through their website along with mobile and desktop applications.

Toggl tracks time based on tasks and projects, either through an interactive task timer or through manual entry. Toggl allows you to track user's online apps.

<strong>Toggl offers the ability to build clients and projects, but also maintains the simplicity of a simple time tracker.</strong>
<h2 class="has-anchor-hash"><strong>Slack</strong><span id="9-slack" class="anchor-hash" aria-hidden="true"></span></h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hebu10lmu/image/upload/v1588680376/content/companies-building-tools-for-remote-teams/slack_nlmwwt.jpg" />

You’d be hard-pressed to find a company not using <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> or a similar communication tool to connect people working together on long-term projects. It assists with organizing communications that require a simple response—where email might otherwise be too bulky and annoying.

If you’re not using it yet, it’s best to download and <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-use-slack/">start using Slack</a> now so you’ll be used to it when a client asks you to use it in the future (and inevitably, <em>they will</em>).

Thanks to its popularity, Slack integrates with a lot of other best tools for freelancers shared on this list, like Google Drive, Trello, and Asana.
<h2><strong>Zapier</strong></h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hebu10lmu/image/upload/v1588680864/content/companies-building-tools-for-remote-teams/zapier-logo_xkpchz.png" />

<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a> is a collaboration software program developed and published by Australian software company Atlassian. Confluence allows you to collect all important documentation and information in one place: a place the whole team has access to. Discussions take place where they are relevant, and where they can be stored and found later on.

Each team and project gets its own place to exchange information, documents, and other data. Access for all team members is controlled by authorization in Confluence.

Team members can work simultaneously on the same document. All changes are saved in real-time.

The days are over when documents existed in multiple versions – which had to be carefully integrated back together again.

<strong>Confluence is your team workspace where knowledge and collaboration meet to accomplish great things.</strong>
<h2><strong>BaseCamp</strong></h2>
<img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hebu10lmu/image/upload/v1588683236/content/companies-building-tools-for-remote-teams/basecamp_2019_logo_lifjgd.png" />

<em>Basecamp</em> is a remote software <em>company</em> based in Chicago, Illinois. The firm was co‑founded in 1999 by Jason Fried, Carlos Segura, and Ernest Kim as a web design <em>company</em>. Since mid‑2004, the <em>company's</em> focus has shifted from web design to web application development.

Basecamp started as a single project management tool for Jason Fried’s web design consultancy called 37signals. It wasn’t originally supposed to be a “product”—rather, it was an in-house tool that the team scrapped together because they needed a better way to handle their own work.

When they <a href="https://medium.com/@Simba_Zhang/two-big-announcements-from-37signals-ac5509a5e6e5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made the announcement</a>, Fried wrote:

<em>“We’ll never forget what made Basecamp so popular in the first place: It just works. It’s simple, it’s easy to use, it’s easy to understand, it’s clear, it’s reliable, and it’s dependable. We’ll continue to make it more of all of those things.”</em>

<strong>BaseCamp's employees are free to live and work wherever they want. They even wrote a book on remote working, REWORK!</strong>
