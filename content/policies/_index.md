**Payment Service Providers and fees**

If you make or receive payments using a Payment Service Provider, you acknowledge and agree that you will comply with any Payment Service Provider terms of service or other agreement between you and the Payment Service Provider. We will not be held liable for any losses or damages, direct or indirect, pecuniary or non-pecuniary, resulting from the actions or omissions of any Payment Service Provider, and we expressly disclaim any responsibility in this regard. Any fees for use of a Payment Service Provider to make payments or receive payments will be borne by you. Any fees imposed on you by a Payment Service Provider are in addition to any fees payable to us.

Except for Remote Team’s role as a limited payment agent for Contractors, Remote Team does not and will not provide banking, deposit taking, stored value, escrow, insurance or any other financial service to Users. Remote Team do not guarantee that the Contractors will pay own freelancers or users. Depending on your location, some Payment Methods may not be available to you, and we cannot guarantee that you will be able to use any Payment Method in connection with the Service even in locations where your preferred Payment Method is available for use. Depending on the desired Payment Method, Users may be required to enter into a separate Payment Service Provider agreement. Your use of any Payment Method is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Payment Service Provider’s rules and regulations and your agreement with them, and we will not be liable to you for any losses you suffer in connection with your use of any third-party payment services. Remote Team is not a party to your Payment Service Provider agreement and will not intervene in any disputes related to payments you make or receive using any third-party Payment Method. Users are solely responsible for payment of insufficient funds fees, overdraft fees, wire transfer fees or other bank fees that you or we incur in connection with Payment Service Provider transaction fees, taxes, and any other third-party Payment Method fees or charges. Remote Team does not charge Contractors any fees for payments processed through the Platform regardless of Payment Method, however, Remote Team is not responsible for any transaction fees, foreign exchange fees or any other fee imposed separately on a Contractor by a Payment Service Provider or by Contractor’s own financial institution. Remote Team is also not responsible for any Payment Service fee changing.

**Disputes and Contract Cancellations**

Reversals and Disputes. Clients should not initiate payments until Contractors have meet the acceptance criteria or other requirements detailed in a Contract. Except to satisfy the compliance obligations set forth in this terms, Remote Team cannot reverse payments or withhold funds from Contractors, and cannot cause Payment Service Providers to reverse payments or withhold funds from Contractors once funds have been received by Remote Team or the relevant Payment Service Provider. If a Client is not satisfied with the service provided by a Contractor or makes a payment in error, the Client must initiate a refund, reversal or other payment dispute process directly with the Contractor or with the relevant Payment Service Provider. Remote Team will not adjudicate payment or Contract disputes between Users regardless of Payment Method or Contract status under any circumstances, and Users are solely responsible for dispute settlement. Refunds and reversals of payments made through a Payment Service Provider are subject to the terms and conditions of your Payment Service Provider agreement.

User-Initiated Contract Cancellation. If a Client owes outstanding payments to a Contractor after completion of work, or if a Client is dissatisfied with the service provided by a Contractor, the Client or Contractor may initiate cancellation of the Contract through the Remote Team dashboard. Cancellation of a Contract through the Remote Team dashboard has no bearing whatsoever on the merits of a Contract dispute, or the interpretation of the terms of, or legality of a Contract. The Service records the initiator of, and the time and date of the cancellation. Users may not initiate or request payment for services related to, or alter the status of a Contract after it has been cancelled.

Contract Cancellation by Remote Team. Remote Team may cancel a Contract in the event of suspicious Account activity or Account compromise; fraud, harassment, and threats; unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices; illegal acts; at the direction of a regulatory authority; or for any other violation of these Terms of Service. Remote Team may also cancel a Contract if a User is no longer a Remote Team Accountholder in good standing. Please contact us if you believe a Contract or another User is in violation of these Terms.

**Severability**

All rights and restrictions contained in this Agreement may be exercised and shall be applicable and binding only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable laws and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary so that they will not render this Agreement illegal, invalid or unenforceable. If any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is the intention of the parties that the remaining provisions or portions thereof shall constitute their agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof, and all such remaining provisions or portions thereof shall remain in full force and effect.
