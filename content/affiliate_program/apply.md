If a sale occurs after Cookie life period expires and the End User has not returned through the Reference Link and purchased the Remote Team Subscription, then no Commission shall occur.

For the avoidance of doubt Commissions shall be paid only for purchases of brand new referrals, that occur after the End User clicked on your particular Reference Link(s) containing your reference ID, directly from the Remote Team Website. In other words, to be eligible for a Commission, the End User you referred shall be a new user for Remote Team, shall use your Reference Link to register and subsequently purchase an account and shall purchase Remote Team Subscription directly from Remote Team Website: any subscriptions, both monthly and annual. In case of purchase by the End User, as described herein of any custom or discounted accounts, Affiliate receives a partial commission of 25% (twenty five percent) from the Remote Team Subscription price.

Your Commission is equal to 25% (twenty five percent) of the total sale amount. Commission Payments via PayPal are processed one a month: on the 10th day of each month: payments on the 10th day cover sales accrued between the 16th and 31st days of the previous month. Please note the applicable payment thresholds described. We also draw your attention to the fact that the money credited to Your Account does not accrue interest. If the End User cancels or does not pay for Remote Team Subscription after the trial period is over, asks for a refund, or uses limited free registration, no Commission will accrue. The commission structure is subject to change at our discretion.

Commissions earned through fraudulent, illegal, or overly aggressive, questionable sales or marketing methods will be voided. Fraudulent activities will also result in immediate account cancelation.

Сhargeback fee will be deducted from your earned Commission.

If you do not withdraw your Commission within 4 months from reaching the applicable payment thresholds described, we reserve the right to charge the amount on the balance with a monthly fee of 10% (ten percent).

Affiliates must withdraw Commission within 2 (two) years since it was accrued. After the expiration of the 2 (two) years period, Remote Team has the right to write off the unclaimed Commission.

From time to time Remote Team may change Remote Team Subscription prices, therefore these changes may affect both the Commission you will earn and the truthfulness of the information you will provide. We cannot guarantee the availability of Remote Team Subscriptions at the prices that you list on Your Website if they are outdated.

RECURRING COMMISSIONS AND COOKIE DURATION.

Unless otherwise stated herein, when the End User with your reference ID  recorded in the Remote Team cookie registers an account with Remote Team, you will receive a commission for as long as the End User maintains the Remote Team paid Subscription on the Remote Team Website or until terminated by either party in accordance with these Remote Team Affiliate Program Terms, provided that you remain eligible to receive a Commission pursuant to Remote Team Affiliate Program Terms.
